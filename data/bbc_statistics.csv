Quick tomato and cream sauce,    This is a quick idea for how to use up a glut of tomatoes from the allotment or garden.,2,6,10,30
Asian-braised shin of beef with hot and sour shredded salad,"    The point of a stew, it should go without saying, is its flavour rather than its form. So, while the crunchy salad strips of carrot, spring onion and pepper do bring colour and beauty to this otherwise brown study, at the same time their texture and Asian-flavoured bite provide the perfect partner for the rich, aromatic spiciness of the soft-braised stew.",6,22,120,30
Turkey meatballs in tomato sauce,"    I have been making meatballs for as long as my children have been eating solid food. I first made them out of turkey mince, rather than my usual preferred beef mince, when I suddenly and uncharacteristically fell victim to the ethos of the age and it came upon me to pander to the low-fat brigade. Obviously, my sub-conscious knew better and directed me thuswards for a reason. It turns out that turkey makes for a light and succulent meatball, which my children love. All in all, this is quite a favourite in casa Lawson these days, and I can be found making a batch  half for tea and half to be frozen for future outings  regularly and pleasurably.",4,14,30,30
Slow-cooked black treacle ham,"    Instead of being boiled and then transferred to a hot oven to be glazed, I cook the ham so, so slowly, in the oven, wrapped in foil, so that it steams sweetly in the low heat. I then remove the ham from the oven, take off the rind, stud the layer of fat on top with cloves and cover with a mustardy black treacle glaze, and put the joint briefly back in a very hot oven. Cooked like this, the meat is astonishingly tender and carves into thin slices with ease; there is also very little shrinkage, and no wrangling with large joints of meat in boiling liquid.",10,6,120,0
Fish tacos,"    I am a broad church: when Im not craving a bowl of food that delivers the same soothing taste from mouthful to mouthful, I like the sort of meal that involves a table full of bits and pieces. I certainly think this latter way of eating is one of the most relaxing ways of sitting around a table with friends. These fish tacos are a case in point, and rest assured that the actual preparation is much more low-effort than you might think. ",4,20,10,30
"Rice bowl with ginger, radish and avocado","    A rice bowl is a wondrous thing, but often  despite the simplicity of its title  a rather cluttered and complicated one. Here, I have pared it back, to make a gorgeously seasoned rice bowl, with nothing more than a few seeds, herbs and radishes stirred through it, and an avocado to top it. Its a simple take on an inspiringly expansive idea. So please use this as a starting point only. Its very much a non-recipe recipe, and every time I make it, I add something different, depending on whats to hand.",2,8,10,30
Old rag pie,"    Old Rag Pie is not the most glamorous name for something which, while being incredibly simple to make, will have you, and anyone who eats it, in raptures. The name is the English translation for the Greek Patsavouropita, created by bakeries as a way of using up old scraps of filo pastry: the ""old rags"" indicated by the title. In Greece, there are two variants, one sweet, one savoury, but this version merges the two, adding honey to salty feta, to create what I can best describe (in taste terms) as a Greek cheesecake.",9,9,30,30
Halloumi with quick sweet chilli sauce,"    There is something so compelling about this squeaky cheese, and my fridge is stocked with it at all times. Most regularly I treat it as vegetarian bacon, dry-fried in a hot pan then dolloped with a peeled, soft-boiled egg. But the idea for this recipe came to me one evening when I felt the need to counter the siren call of the halloumis saltiness with some sweet-and-heat.",2,6,10,30
Roast squash and sweet potato soup with buttermilk blue cheese sauce,    I have to have a regular supply of this squash and sweet potato soup at Christmas - it really is one of my freezer favourites.,8,11,30,30
Breakfast bars 2.0,"    This is my new, improved breakfast bar recipe: gluten-free, dairy-free and enough seeds to make you start sprouting. Ive used no sugar, but before you start thinking this is virtuously sugar-free (which I could claim it to be), remember that the sweetness that comes from the dates is, in essence, sugar, though certainly its unprocessed and full of fibre at the same time.Make these bars at the weekend, and you be set up for the week if you someone who needs to grab-and-go in the morning. ",16,18,10,30
Oat pancakes with raspberries and honey,"    Think of these rather like the oatcakes you might have with cheese, only in pancake form; as with regular fluffy pancakes, however, it is what you eat with them that creates the magic. Here, Ive made a honey and raspberry syrup, and the mixture of the soft, oaty cakes, the honey and the raspberries has a decidedly Scottish flavour. ",6,10,10,30
Prawns with spicy dipping sauce,"    Be careful with the harissa. Not only do samples vary enormously in strength, but also be aware that some jars that bear the name are not really harissa, but a paste made red with beetroot and carrot.",4,5,0,30
Parmesan shortbreads,"    I go into auto-Parmesan-shortbread mode whenever I have friends coming for supper, as not only is it perfect with drinks, but it can be made in advance. Indeed you can make the dough, wrap it and then leave it in the fridge for up to three days before slicing an baking, although you will need to let these cheese-scented cylinders sit out on a kitchen surface just long enough to get the fridge-chill off them before slicing.",35,4,10,30
Squid and prawns with chilli and marjoram,"    I love to serve this along with plain, boiled Italian black rice, which I advise for its drama as well as its sauce-soaking capacity. But if you want to stretch the amounts below to feed more people, then cook a packet of spaghetti and toss the lemony chilli-flecked seafood through it, making sure you use a little pasta cooking water to help the sauce emulsify.",4,9,10,30
Baby aubergines with oregano and red onions,"    I like the way this dish can be eaten as a starter or part of an antipasti table, and even more as a main course, sprinkled with some ricotta salata (the deliciously salted, dried kind) or crumbled feta, or as an accompaniment to meat and fish.Each serving provides 140kcal, 1g protein, 3g carbohydrate (of which 3g sugars), 13g fat (of which 2g saturates), 2.5g fibre and 0.8g salt.",6,10,30,30
Tuscan fries,"    Cesare Casella, a chef from Lucca, whose family used to run the fabulous Vipore restaurant and who is now cooking in New York, is the man who invented Tuscan fries. Think French fries, but with garlic cloves and fresh herbs thrown into the hot oil towards the end of the cooking time.",4,5,10,30
Maple-roast parsnips,    A generous glug of maple syrup makes all the difference in Nigella Lawsons easy roast parsnips recipe.,8,3,30,30
Potato and pepper bake,"    I never feel the need to apologize for using jars of chargrilled peppers, for while I don eat them just as they are, I find them the most useful ingredient. Just make sure that you are using peppers that are preserved in oil rather than brine. The potatoes don roast in this oil, so much as braise: they will crisp up in parts, but mostly just become softened and rich in the sweet peppery juices.",8,6,30,30
Sweet and sour slaw,"    Here is an exercise in chopping meditation for you! There is much to slice, but you end up with a bright tangle of slaw that feeds a crowd and has enough zing in it to bring a table of cold cuts to life. ",10,12,0,30
Chocolate peanut butter cheesecake,"    I feel a bit apologetic for the overindulgent vulgarity that is this cheesecake here. But, really, why should I be sorry? You won be once youve eaten it; though perhaps I should warn that its not for the faint-hearted. Unashamed indulgence, wallowingly so, is what this recipe is all about.",10,13,60,30
Strawberry and almond crumble,"    This is a crumble of dreams. This is nothing short of alchemy: you take the vilest, crunchiest supermarket strawberries, top them with an almondy, buttery rubble, bake and turn them on a cold day into the taste of English summer. Naturally, serve with lashings of cream: I regard this is as obligatory, not optional.For this recipe you will need 1 ovenproof pie dish approximately 21cm/10in diameter x 4cm/2in deep (approx. 1.25 litre/2 pints capacity).",6,10,30,30
Chocolate pistachio fudge,"    If I'm not handing this straight round at a party or with coffee after dinner, I might keep half in my freezer, and put the other half in a box or two for Christmas presents. Make sure they stay cold, though.",64,5,10,30
Christmas rocky road,"    A no-bake Christmas treat that can easily be adjusted according to your own preferences. It's wonderful for making with children too.This recipe appears in Nigella Lawson's book Feast, published by Chatto & Windus.",24,10,10,30

Spruced-up vanilla cake,    Nigella's simple vanilla cake is anything but boring. Perfect with a cup of tea as an afternoon treat.,12,8,30,30
Star topped mincepies,"    I used to think that making your own mince pies was a ridiculous notion. Believe me, it isn't. ",36,8,10,60
Triple chocolate buckwheat cookies,"    The star here is the buckwheat, not only because it makes these cookies gluten-free, but mainly because I feel it brings its own nutty flavour and unique texture, creating a cookie that has softness and a shortbready bite, as well as a subtle smokiness. Those who like a truly chewy cookie might find these a little cakey, but I like chewiness in a cookie and yet find constant excuses to make these.",25,10,10,30
Cider and 5-spice bundt cake,"    Most of the time I refer to this as my Cider and five-spice gingerbread, but I changed the name out of concern for those who expect a little more gingeriness from their gingerbead. If you want to intensify the ginger element, use 250ml/9fl oz ginger beer in place of the cider.This cake is wonderful enough plain as it is, though I have something of a faiblesse for the gleaming accompaniment of the smoky salted caramel sauce, as you can see from the picture.For this recipe you will need a 2\xc2\xbd/4\xc2\xbd pints litre capacity bundt tin or a 20cm/8in square cake tin (approx. 5\xc2\xbdcm/2\xc2\xbcin deep).",1,18,30,30
Apricot almond cake with rosewater and cardamom,"    This is my idea of a perfect cake: simple, beautiful, fragrant and beguiling. Ive been making this sort of cake, in one form or another, since my clementine cake in How To Eat, and I can help but feel, with a certain calm excitement, that it has reached its apogee here. For this recipe you will need a 20cm/8in round springform cake tin and a food processor.",8,13,30,30

Tamarind-marinated bavette steak,"    Skirt or flank steak is eaten a lot in America, and in France, but hardly at all here in the UK. This is madness, as it is so much cheaper than any other sort of steak and so rich in flavour. I think what has put people off in the past is that, in Britain, it has been cooked in low and slow braises, which turns it into shoe leather. Bavette is the external part of the skirt (onglet being the internal connecting tissue) and all you need to do to cook it is, as my butcher puts it, \xe2\u20ac\u0153sear the hell out of it and serve it rare\xe2\u20ac\ufffd.

"Lamb cutlets with mint, chilli and golden potatoes","    If you put your halved baby potatoes on to steam before you get started on the lamb chops, you can fairly effortlessly rely on a proper meat-and-potato supper in around 20 minutes (plus a little marinading time). Steaming the potatoes is, for me, an important stipulation: a steamed spud is a sweet spud; more than that, cooked this way, rather than by boiling, the potatoes are dry when done, which makes them easy to fry to crisp bronzedness.",4,10,10,30
Sardinian couscous with clams,"    At the time of writing, I confess you will need to go to an Italian deli or specialist food outlet for fregola, the sun-dried and toasted Sardinian \xe2\u20ac\u0153couscous\xe2\u20ac\ufffd specified for this recipe.

Lemon and lavender posset with lavender biscuits,"    A posset is a very simple pudding that dates back to the middle ages. Some possets can be very heavy on the cream, but Ive used lemon juice and fragrant lavender to cut the richness.",4,8,120,120
Cumberland rum Nicky,"    This traditional northern treat is a real favourite of mine. Its stuffed with sticky dates and treacly brown sugar and laced with ginger and rum. Nicky may stem from the original technique of covering the filling with a whole piece of pastry then making slashes or nicks in it.Equipment and preparation: for this recipe you will need a 20cm/8in metal pie dish, about 3cm/1\xc2\xbcin deep.",6,14,30,30

Scotch pies,"    Also known as mutton pies, these have a very long history. In the middle ages, they were frowned upon by the Scottish church, viewed as luxurious, decadent English-style food. In later centuries, they proved to be convenient and sustaining snacks for working people, who would buy them hot from pie-men or pie-wives in the city streets. The space on top of the pie, created by the raised crust, would sometimes be filled with gravy, beans or mashed potato.",4,9,30,30

Lamb and kidney suet pudding with rosemary,"    When it comes to comfort food, you just can beat a traditional, steamed suet pudding like this one.

Meat and potato pie,"    This is one of my favourite pies: a great, no-nonsense recipe that does exactly what it says on the tin, and is all the better for it. I use chuck steak (also known as braising steak), which has lots of flavour, and two types of potato: a floury variety, which falls apart and thickens the gravy, and a waxier type that holds its shape to provide texture.",4,7,120,30
